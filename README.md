# DesignPatterns
* This repo contains three projects from the university course "Design Patterns".
* Their main purpose is to demonstrate the practical application and usage of the three main group design patterns - Creational, Structural and Behavioral.
* About the projects:
    1. Project 1 ("Figure Manager") - this project uses Abstract Factory, Factory and Prototype patterns.
    2. Project 2 ("Labels Hierarchy") - this project uses Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Dependency injection, Proxy, Strategy and Template Method (some of them might be omitted          or slightly changed from their common appearance due to design considerations)
    3. Project 3 ("Checksum Tracker") - this project uses Composite, Observer, Strategy, Template method, Builder, Visitor (again some might be ommited or still not                      implemented like the Memento pattern).
 
- Find the exact project descriptions in the folder "Project Descriptions"(note that there might be some changes due to some discussions in class for better design)
